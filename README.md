# 🧠 Axon: An AI Tutor for Deep Understanding

A project to transform Large Language Models from information-retrievers into genuine tutors, making deep learning accessible and intuitive.

### The Spark ✨: Gratitude & Frustration

Like many, I'm deeply grateful for how AI expands our ability to grapple with new subjects. It has made me more courageous and more inclined to dive into topics I once found intimidating.

But I kept hitting a frustrating wall. When using an AI to learn, I found I was constantly acting as both **the teacher and the student**.

> I had to step outside of my own learning process to guide the AI, to coax a method out of it, and to structure the lesson myself. It broke the natural flow of learning and made the process a chore.

### The Insight 💡: Building on a Solid Foundation

This frustration led me to a first-principles approach. I delved into what it truly means to understand something. The core insight is this: **knowledge is a structure, built upon a foundation**.

When you fail to grasp a new concept, the problem often isn't the concept itself, but a crack in one of its foundational pillars—a more fundamental piece of the puzzle that you haven't fully grasped.

### The Solution 🚀: A Systematic Tutor

Axon was born from this idea. I wanted to create a framework that embeds this systematic process directly into the AI, so the user can focus solely on being the student.

It's designed to be the teacher I was missing. It has a simple but rigorous method:

1.  **🩺 Diagnose:** It first breaks a topic down into its core pillars and works with you to find the true source of your confusion.
2.  **👨‍🏫 Explain:** It then addresses that single weak point with a clear, targeted explanation, using simple language and analogies.
3.  **✅ Verify:** Finally, it helps you test that new knowledge in a practical way, ensuring the foundation is solid before building upon it.

The goal of Axon is to solve the "teacher-and-student" problem. It’s a step towards an AI that makes learning a more focused, less frustrating, and ultimately more rewarding experience for anyone brave enough to tackle a new subject.
